To start just open two terminals:
In the 1st terminal navigate to the backend/src directory and type `node server.js`
In the 2nd terminal navigate to the frontend directory and type `npm start`

I attached a second project which is the Real-time chat app since I didn't have enough time to finish the chat feature in the Art Talks App:(
